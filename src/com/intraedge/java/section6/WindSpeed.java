/**
 * Design a class to depict wind speed often measured in kilometer per hours (km/h).
 * Other units of wind speed are knots (nautic miles) and the Beaufort scale consisting 
 * of integer numbers from 1 to 12.
 * Implement a constructor to create wind speed for a given velocity in kilometers per hour. 
 * The class must contain methods for getting the speed as knots or on the Beaufort scale. 
 * Furthermore, it must be possible to check whether the wind is calm or a European windstorm (Orcan).
 * Wind speeds less than 2 km/h are calm. More than 120 km/h is a European windstorm. 
 * A nautic mile is 1,852 Kilometer. The Beaufort scale is defined by v = 3,01 * B^(3/2), 
 * with v as the wind velocity in km/h. The Beaufort value B is rounded to the nearest integer. 
 * There are no Beaufort values larger than 12.
