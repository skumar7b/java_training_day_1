/**
 * Design and implement a queue. A queue is an abstract data type for adding and removing elements. The elements are
 * added to a queue in FIFO order. Design an interface queue with methods to add and remove integers. Also, a method
 * to check if the queue is empty or not should exist. 
 * Implement the queue with an array. If the array becomes small to hold all the added elements, create a new
 * larger array and copy all the elements of the small array to the new one
