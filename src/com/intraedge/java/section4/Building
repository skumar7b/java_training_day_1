/**
 * The public class here is Building. A Building has tools like CinderBlock and Ladder.The Building makes use construction 
 * vehicles like DumpTruck and BullDozer to get built. The Building has workers like Mason and Plumber who work on it. 
 * You can see that all these composed classes are defined in this same file. This is not a good practice. Packages help
 * organize and maintain code easily. Your job is to extract these composed classes into their own packages. The CinderBlock 
 * and Ladder classes can go into a package called org.construction.tools. The DumpTruck and BullDozer classes can go into 
 * a package called org.construction.vehicles. The Mason and Plumber classes can go into a package called
 * org.construction.workers. Create these packages in your source folder, move the respective classes into them,
 * and import them into this Building class to use them.
