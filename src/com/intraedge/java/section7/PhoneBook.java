/**
 * You will create a phone book containing names and numbers of 'n' people.
 * You will then search the phone book for information based on some input data.
 * When run, the program should first ask you to type the number of phone book
 * entries. If you type '5', the program should ask you to enter  
 * 'name-number' combinations for 5 people and store them in a data structure.
 * The program should then ask you to search for an entry by first name,
 * last name, full name, or partial name and print the result for you.
 * Questions to ask yourself:
 * 1. What data structure do you use to store this kind of information?
 * 2. What if two people have the exact same names? How will you store their phone numbers?
